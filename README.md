- Hi, Iâ€™m @Mtbal
- I'm really interested in technology. My main interests ðŸ‘€ are: programming, Information Security, gaming, hacking and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- I am currently deepening my knowledge in the area of application development. Specifically, right now I'm really interested in two subjects. The first is Machine Learning and how Robots can learn from mistakes. The second is Information Security. The new post-pandemic era presents many challenges regarding data security.
- I try to collaborate with articles. I have more than a thousand published texts. I'm interested in how technology can improve people's lives, how these people can defend themselves from cyber attacks, and awareness of the importance of technology and Information Security for businesses and people.
